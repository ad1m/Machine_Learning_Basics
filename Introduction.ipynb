    "<h4>Machine Learning Tasks:</h4>\n",
    "<p>There are many different types of tasks that machine learning can solve:</p>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li><b>Classification:</b> Classification deals with classifying an input into one of $k$ categories. We might, for instance, want to take a picture and decide whether it is a bird, cat, or dog. When we have more than two classes we have a \"multiclass\" classification problem. When we are looking at predicting two classes we have a \"binary\" classification problem. Mathematically speaking, the learning algorithm produces a function $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\{1,2,...,k \\}$. This notation means that we have an $n$ dimensional vector with values as real numbers that gets mapped to a discrete value in the set $\\{1,2,...,k \\}$ where $\\{1,2,...,k\\}$ are the classes of the classification problem. This function takes in a vector $x$ and outputs a value $y$ such that $f(x)=y$. An alternate variation of classification is where the function $f$ outputs a probability distribution over classes. For example, we would return a vector $v$ such as [.2,.7,.1] which  means the probability that the input $x$ is class 1 is .2, the probability $x$ is class 2 is .7, and the probability $x$ is class 3 is .1. We can take the maximum value of this probability distribution over the classes to see that class 2 is the most probable classification for the input $x$. Classification produces discrete values. Discrete data can only take particular values. There may potentially be an infinite number of those values, but each is distinct and there's no grey area in between. Discrete data can be numeric like numbers of oranges, but it can also be categorical like red or blue or male or female.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Classification with missing inputs:</b> With regular classification above, each input vector $x$ has to have the same dimension. This means that if we have a sample $x_1$ = [5,13,4,5] then $x_2$ must have 4 values like $x_1$, making it a vector of dimension 4. If we do not have a gurantee that every measurement in the input vector will be provided then this makes classification more difficult. For a solution to this problem, we need the learning algorithm to define a single function mapping from the input vector to a categorical output. The learning algorithm learns a set of functions where each function corresponds to classifying the input $x$ with a different subset of its missing input values. If we have an $n$ dimensional feature vector than there will be $2^n$ different classification functions needed for each possible set of missing inputs.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Regression:</b> Regression tasks involve predicting a continuous value given an input $x$. Continuous data are not restricted to defined separate values, but can occupy any value over a continuous range. Between any two continuous data values there may be an infinite number of others. Continuous data are always essentially numeric. For instance, predicting the price of a stock is a regression problem since the value of the stock we predict could be any real number between 0 and infinity. Mathematically speaking, we take an input $x$ and pass it through a function $f:\\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ which means we take our $n$ dimensional input vector, pass it through the function $f$ and output a single real number.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Transcription: </b> Transcription involves the machine learning algorithm observing some unstructured data and transcribing it into a discrete textual form. For example, the algorithm might see an image of a license plate and transcribe it into text. Alternatively, the algorithm could be given a song and transcribe the audio into textual lyrics.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Machine Translation: </b>machine translations takes a sequence of symbols in one language and converts it into a sequence of symbols in another language. For example, converting a sentence from french to english. Google translate is an example of machine translation. </li>\n",
    "<li><b>Anomaly Detection: </b>anomaly detection deals with the indentification of items, events, or observations which do not conform to an expected pattern or other items in a dataset. Here we search for unusual or atypical items in the dataset. For instance, looking for fradulent checks or identifying fraudlent credit card transactions are examples of anomaly detection.</li>\n",

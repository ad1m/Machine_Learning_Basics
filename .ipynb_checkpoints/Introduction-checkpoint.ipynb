When we have more than two classes we have a \"multiclass\" classification problem. When we are looking at predicting two classes we have a \"binary\" classification problem. Mathematically speaking, the learning algorithm produces a function $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\{1,2,...,k \\}$. This notation means that we have an $n$ dimensional vector with values as real numbers that gets mapped to a discrete value in the set $\\{1,2,...,k \\}$ where $\\{1,2,...,k\\}$ are the classes of the classification problem. This function takes in a vector $x$ and outputs a value $y$ such that $f(x)=y$.</li>\n",
